**ABV:** 0% (no alcohol)  
**Prep Time:** 30 minutes  
**Ready to Drink:** 2-4 hours (chilled) or immediately  
**Style:** Carbonated spiced honey beverage  

## Ingredients

### Base Recipe
- **12-16 tablespoons high-quality honey** (3/4 to 1 cup - wildflower or orange blossom)
- **10-12 cups filtered water** (for spice tea preparation)
- **2-4 cups sparkling water, seltzer, or club soda** (added just before serving)
- **1/4 cup apple cider vinegar** (adds complexity and tartness)
- **1 teaspoon vanilla extract** (adds depth)
- **1/2 teaspoon sea salt** (enhances all flavors)

### Essential Spice Blend
- **4 cinnamon sticks** (Ceylon preferred, broken into pieces)
- **2 teaspoons green cardamom pods** (lightly crushed)
- **1 teaspoon whole cloves**
- **2-inch piece fresh ginger** (sliced thin)
- **1 teaspoon black peppercorns** (lightly cracked)

### Optional Enhancement Spices
- **2 whole star anise** (adds licorice notes)
- **1 teaspoon fennel seeds** (subtle sweetness)
- **4 vanilla beans** (split and scraped - in addition to extract)
- **1/2 teaspoon allspice berries** (warm complexity)
- **1 whole nutmeg** (freshly grated)

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Spice Tea Preparation
1. **Toast the spices** (optional but recommended):
   - Heat a large dry pan over medium heat
   - Add all whole spices except fresh ginger
   - Toast 2-3 minutes until fragrant, stirring constantly
   - Remove from heat

2. **Create spice tea concentrate**:
   - Bring 4 cups water to a rolling boil
   - Add all toasted spices and fresh ginger
   - Reduce heat and simmer 20-25 minutes
   - Remove from heat, steep additional 15 minutes
   - Strain through fine mesh strainer, pressing spices gently
   - **You should have 2.5-3 cups concentrated spice tea**

### Phase 2: Honey Base Creation
1. **Prepare honey mixture**:
   - Heat 2 cups of the spice tea to warm (140Â°F)
   - Dissolve honey completely in warm spice tea
   - Stir until no honey remains undissolved
   - Add vanilla extract and sea salt

2. **Create base mead**:
   - Add remaining spice tea (should be 6-8 cups total liquid)
   - Add apple cider vinegar and stir well
   - Cool to room temperature
   - **Taste and adjust**: Add more honey for sweetness, vinegar for tartness

### Phase 3: Carbonation and Final Assembly
1. **Prepare for serving**:
   - Chill base mead mixture for 2-4 hours minimum
   - Chill sparkling water separately
   - Use 1-gallon glass container or multiple smaller containers

2. **Add carbonation** (just before serving):
   - Fill serving glasses 2/3 full with chilled base mead
   - Top with chilled sparkling water, seltzer, or club soda (1:2 or 1:3 ratio)
   - Stir gently to combine
   - **Alternative**: Mix entire batch 3:1 ratio (base:carbonated water) for parties

## Carbonation Options Explained

### Sparkling Water
- **Best for**: Pure, clean carbonation that doesn't compete with flavors
- **Taste**: Neutral, lets honey and spice flavors shine
- **Brands**: LaCroix, Perrier, San Pellegrino (unflavored)

### Seltzer Water  
- **Best for**: Very similar to sparkling water, excellent choice
- **Taste**: Clean and neutral, virtually identical to sparkling water
- **Brands**: Polar, Canada Dry Seltzer, generic store brands

### Club Soda
- **Best for**: Adding subtle mineral complexity
- **Taste**: Slightly salty/mineral taste from added sodium and minerals
- **Effect**: Can enhance the "ancient" mead character with mineral notes
- **Brands**: Schweppes, Canada Dry Club Soda, Q Club Soda

**Recommendation**: Start with seltzer or sparkling water for the cleanest flavor, try club soda if you want subtle mineral complexity.

## Serving Suggestions

### Traditional Service
- Serve in wine glasses over ice
- Garnish with cinnamon stick and orange peel
- Add fresh thyme or rosemary sprig

### Festive Presentation
- Rim glasses with cinnamon sugar

### Seasonal Variations
**Winter Warmer**: Serve slightly warm (not hot) without sparkling water
**Summer Refresher**: Extra sparkling water ratio, serve over crushed ice

## Customization Options

### Sweetness Adjustments
- **Less sweet**: Reduce honey to 8-10 tablespoons
- **Sweeter**: Increase honey to 18-20 tablespoons  
- **Complex sweetness**: Mix honey varieties (wildflower + buckwheat)

### Spice Intensity Levels
**Mild Spice** (family-friendly):
- Use only cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger
- Reduce steeping time to 15 minutes

**Medium Spice** (as written):
- Follow recipe as stated
- Perfect balance for most palates

**Bold Spice** (intense):
- Double all spice quantities
- Add extra pepper and cloves
- Steep for 30+ minutes

### Carbonation Levels
- **Light fizz**: 4:1 ratio (base:sparkling)
- **Medium fizz**: 3:1 ratio (recommended)
- **High fizz**: 2:1 ratio (very bubbly)
- **Maximum fizz**: 1:1 ratio (like soda)

## Storage and Make-Ahead Tips

### Base Preparation
- **Spice tea base**: Can be made 2-3 days ahead, refrigerated
- **Honey base**: Mix and store up to 1 week refrigerated
- **Batch prep**: Make double batch of base, store half for later

### Carbonation Strategy
- **Never pre-mix carbonated water** - goes flat quickly
- **Individual serving**: Mix as you pour each glass
- **Party batch**: Mix just before guests arrive
- **Leftover base**: Keeps 1-2 weeks refrigerated
- **Carbonation choice**: Seltzer and sparkling water are interchangeable

### Scaling Tips
- **Half batch**: Cut all ingredients in half (2 quarts)
- **Double batch**: Double everything (2 gallons)
- **Party size**: Triple recipe serves 15-20 people

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Too spicy**: Dilute with more honey water mixture
**Not spicy enough**: Add pinch of ground spices to individual glasses  
**Too sweet**: Add more apple cider vinegar gradually
**Too tart**: Add honey one tablespoon at a time
**Flat carbonation**: Use fresher carbonated water, serve immediately

### Quality Tips
- **Use quality honey**: Flavor matters significantly in final product
- **Fresh spices**: Whole spices provide better flavor than pre-ground
- **Proper ratios**: Taste base before adding sparkling water
- **Temperature**: Serve well-chilled for best flavor
- **Timing**: Add carbonation just before serving for maximum fizz
- **Carbonation choice**: Seltzer = cleanest taste, club soda = mineral complexity

## Nutritional Notes
- **Calories**: Approximately 60-80 per 8 oz serving
- **Sugar content**: Natural honey sugars only
- **Sodium**: Minimal from sea salt
- **No artificial ingredients**: All natural flavoring
- **Gluten-free**: Safe for gluten-sensitive guests
