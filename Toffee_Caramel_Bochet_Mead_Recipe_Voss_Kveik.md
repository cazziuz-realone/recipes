# Toffee Caramel Bochet Mead with Voss Kveik

## Recipe Overview
**Yield:** 1 gallon  
**OG:** 1.132 (30.53 Brix)  
**Target FG:** 1.020-1.025 (5-6.3 Brix)  
**ABV:** 14-15%  
**Fermentation Time:** 7-14 days (much faster than K1V-1116!)  

## Ingredients

### Primary Fermentation
- **3.82 lbs Orange Blossom Honey** (for caramelization)
- **1 packet (11g) LalBrew VOSS Kveik** or **2-3 grams if using liquid**
- **3 grams GoFerm Protect** (increased for Kveik stress tolerance)
- **1.2 grams Potassium Carbonate** (pH buffering)
- **6 grams Fermaid-O total** (enhanced protocol for Kveik)

### Secondary/Stabilization
- **1 Campden tablet** (Sodium Metabisulfite)
- **1/4 tsp Potassium Sorbate**
- **Optional: 1 oz Medium Toast American Oak Cubes**

## Voss Kveik Advantages for Bochet

**Why Voss improves this recipe:**
- **Heat tolerance:** Can ferment the warm bochet must immediately (no cooling wait)
- **Ester production:** Creates subtle tropical fruit notes that complement caramel flavors beautifully
- **Speed:** Completes fermentation in 1-2 weeks vs. 4-8 weeks with wine yeast
- **Clean character:** Won't compete with the complex caramelized honey flavors
- **High flocculation:** Clears faster for quicker enjoyment

## Instructions

### Honey Preparation (Unchanged)
1. **SAFETY FIRST:** Use a pot 3-4 times the volume of honey
2. Pour honey into large heavy-bottomed pot
3. Bring to low boil, watching carefully for boil-over
4. **Caramelize for 20-25 minutes** until dark amber/caramel color
5. Remove from heat when you smell rich toffee aromas

### Must Preparation (Voss-Optimized)
1. Heat 2 quarts water to boiling, remove from heat
2. **Slowly** add hot water to caramelized honey, stirring constantly
3. Transfer to sanitized 2-gallon bucket
4. Add water to reach 1 gallon total
5. **Target temperature: 75-85°F** (Voss can handle warmer must)

### Voss Yeast Preparation
1. **Enhanced rehydration:** Mix 3g GoFerm with 100ml water at 95-105°F
2. Cool GoFerm solution to 95°F
3. Add entire packet of LalBrew VOSS, stir gently
4. **Wait 15 minutes** for full activation
5. **Temperature match:** Ensure within 15°F of must temperature

### Primary Fermentation (Accelerated Schedule)

**Day 0 - Pitching:**
- Add activated Voss to must when temperature is 70-85°F
- Stir thoroughly to distribute
- **Take gravity reading** (should be ~1.132)

**Enhanced Nutrient Protocol for Voss:**
- **Day 1 (24 hours):** 1.5g Fermaid-O
- **Day 2 (48 hours):** 1.5g Fermaid-O  
- **Day 3 (72 hours):** 1.5g Fermaid-O
- **Day 5-7:** 1.5g Fermaid-O (at 1/3 sugar break or day 7)

**Aeration Schedule:**
- **Days 1-2:** Aerate twice daily (morning/evening)
- **Days 3-4:** Once daily until fermentation slows
- **Stop aeration** when gravity drops below 1.080

### Fermentation Management

**Temperature Control:**
- **Optimal range:** 75-85°F (room temperature works great)
- **Can handle up to 95°F** if fermenting in warm conditions
- Voss produces **pleasant esters** at higher temperatures

**Timeline Expectations:**
- **Hours 6-12:** Fermentation begins (much faster than wine yeast)
- **Days 1-3:** Vigorous primary fermentation
- **Days 5-7:** Fermentation slowing, 1/3 sugar break
- **Days 7-14:** Fermentation completion
- **Day 10-14:** Ready to rack (gravity 1.020-1.025)

### Secondary Fermentation

**Racking (Week 2):**
1. Rack to clean carboy when fermentation stops
2. Add 1 crushed Campden tablet and 1/4 tsp Potassium Sorbate
3. **Optional enhancement:** Add 1 oz medium toast oak cubes for complexity
4. Attach airlock

**Clearing Phase:**
- **Voss advantage:** Excellent flocculation means faster clearing
- **2-4 weeks:** Should be clear enough to read through
- **Total time:** 4-6 weeks vs. 2-4 months with wine yeast

### Final Processing

**Bottling:**
- Rack one final time when crystal clear
- **Taste test:** Should have rich caramel-toffee with subtle tropical fruit complexity
- Bottle in standard wine bottles
- **Age minimum 2 months** for best flavor integration

## Voss-Specific Modifications Explained

### Why These Changes Work:

**Increased GoFerm (2.5g → 3g):**
- Voss benefits from enhanced micronutrients for stress tolerance

**Enhanced Fermaid-O (5.5g → 6g):**
- Faster fermentation requires more nutrition
- Supports ester production that complements caramel flavors

**Temperature Flexibility:**
- Can pitch into warmer must (75-85°F vs. waiting for 70°F)
- Saves hours of cooling time

**Accelerated Timeline:**
- Primary: 1-2 weeks vs. 4-8 weeks
- Total time: 6-8 weeks vs. 4-6 months ready to drink

### Expected Flavor Profile

**Base Character:** Rich toffee and caramel from bochet process
**Voss Enhancement:** Subtle tropical fruit esters (orange, mango hints)
**Integration:** The esters complement rather than compete with caramel
**Finish:** Semi-sweet with complex layered sweetness
**Best Drinking:** 2-6 months (peak integration)

## Troubleshooting Voss Fermentation

**If fermentation seems slow:**
- Check temperature (needs 70°F minimum)
- Add more nutrients if stuck
- Voss is very reliable - be patient

**If too much ester character:**
- Lower temperature next batch (stay closer to 70-75°F)
- Voss esters are generally pleasant with caramel

**If finishes too dry:**
- Back-sweeten with additional caramelized honey
- Stabilize first with Campden and sorbate

## Why Voss Is Perfect for Bochet

The combination of Voss Kveik with caramelized honey creates a unique flavor profile impossible with traditional wine yeasts. The tropical fruit esters from Voss enhance the toffee-caramel complexity, creating layers of flavor that develop beautifully over time. Plus, you'll be drinking this exceptional mead months earlier than with the original recipe!
