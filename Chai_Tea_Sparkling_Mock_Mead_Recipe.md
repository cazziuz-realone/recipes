## Recipe Overview
**Batch Size:** 1 gallon (128 oz)  
**ABV:** 0% (no alcohol)  
**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
**Ready to Drink:** 2-4 hours (chilled) or immediately  
**Style:** Carbonated chai-spiced honey beverage  

## Ingredients

### Base Recipe
- **12-16 tablespoons high-quality honey** (3/4 to 1 cup - wildflower or orange blossom)
- **10-12 cups filtered water** (for chai tea preparation)
- **2-4 cups sparkling water, seltzer, or club soda** (added just before serving)
- **1/4 cup apple cider vinegar** (adds complexity and tartness)
- **1 teaspoon vanilla extract** (adds depth)
- **1/2 teaspoon sea salt** (enhances all flavors)

### Chai Tea Base
- **8-10 chai tea bags** (high-quality brands like Tazo Chai, Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice, or Traditional Medicinals)
- **2-inch piece fresh ginger** (sliced thin - for extra ginger intensity)
- **2 cinnamon sticks** (optional - for enhanced cinnamon)

### Optional Enhancements
- **2 vanilla beans** (split and scraped - in addition to extract)
- **1 whole star anise** (if your chai blend doesn't include it)
- **1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg**

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Chai Tea Concentrate Preparation
1. **Create strong chai concentrate**:
   - Bring 6 cups water to a rolling boil
   - Remove from heat and add all chai tea bags
   - Add fresh ginger slices and cinnamon sticks (if using)
   - **Steep for 15-20 minutes** (longer than normal tea for stronger flavor)
   - Remove tea bags, pressing gently to extract flavor
   - Strain out ginger slices and cinnamon sticks
   - **You should have 5-6 cups concentrated chai tea**

2. **Optional spice boost** (if using enhancement spices):
   - Return chai concentrate to heat
   - Add star anise or nutmeg if desired
   - Simmer gently for 5 minutes
   - Strain out whole spices

### Phase 2: Honey Base Creation
1. **Prepare honey mixture**:
   - Heat 2 cups of the chai concentrate to warm (140Â°F)
   - Dissolve honey completely in warm chai tea
   - Stir until no honey remains undissolved
   - Add vanilla extract and sea salt

2. **Create base mead**:
   - Add remaining chai concentrate (should be 6-8 cups total liquid)
   - Add apple cider vinegar and stir well
   - Cool to room temperature
   - **Taste and adjust**: Add more honey for sweetness, vinegar for tartness

### Phase 3: Carbonation and Final Assembly
1. **Prepare for serving**:
   - Chill base chai mead mixture for 2-4 hours minimum
   - Chill sparkling water separately
   - Use 1-gallon glass container or multiple smaller containers

2. **Add carbonation** (just before serving):
   - Fill serving glasses 2/3 full with chilled base mead
   - Top with chilled sparkling water, seltzer, or club soda (1:2 or 1:3 ratio)
   - Stir gently to combine
   - **Alternative**: Mix entire batch 3:1 ratio (base:carbonated water) for parties
