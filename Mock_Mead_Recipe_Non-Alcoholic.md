## Serving Suggestions

### Immediate Serving
- Serve over ice for refreshing drink
- Garnish with lemon slice or fresh herbs
- Shake or stir before serving (honey may settle)

### Aged Flavor (24-48 hours)
- Store in refrigerator for 1-2 days
- Flavors meld and develop complexity
- Shake well before serving

### Carbonated Version
- Use sparkling water for final dilution
- Add just before serving to maintain fizz
- Creates a "mead spritzer" effect

## Customization Tips

### Sweetness Adjustment
- **Less sweet:** Reduce honey to 2 tablespoons
- **Sweeter:** Increase honey to 5-6 tablespoons
- **Complex sweetness:** Mix honey types (wildflower + orange blossom)

### Acidity Balance
- **More tart:** Increase vinegar to 1.5 tablespoons
- **Less tart:** Reduce vinegar to 2 teaspoons
- **Different acid:** Try lemon juice instead of vinegar

### Color Enhancement
- **Golden color:** Use darker honey varieties
- **Ruby color:** Add hibiscus tea
- **Amber color:** Add a pinch of caramel extract

## Storage & Shelf Life
- **Refrigerated:** 1-2 weeks in sealed mason jar
- **Room temperature:** 2-3 days maximum
- **Freezer:** Up to 3 months (may separate when thawed)
- **Always shake before serving** - ingredients naturally separate

## Why This Works
- **Honey provides** the primary mead sweetness and body
- **Apple cider vinegar mimics** the slight tartness from fermentation
- **Vanilla adds complexity** similar to aged mead character
- **Salt enhances** all flavors and adds mineral character
- **Time allows** flavors to meld like traditional mead aging

## Scaling Up
- **Half gallon:** Double all ingredients
- **Full gallon:** Multiply all ingredients by 4
- **Party batch:** Scale up to desired quantity
- **Always taste and adjust** - honey potency varies by type

This mock mead captures the essence of traditional mead - honey sweetness, slight complexity, and refreshing character - without any fermentation process!
