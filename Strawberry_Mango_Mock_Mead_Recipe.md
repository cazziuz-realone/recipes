## Recipe Overview
**Batch Size:** 1 gallon (128 oz)  
**ABV:** 0% (no alcohol)  
**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
**Ready to Drink:** 2-4 hours (after cooling) or immediately  
**Storage:** Perfect for counter dispensers at room temperature  
**Flavor Profile:** Sweet, fruity, tropical with honey richness

## Ingredients

### Base Recipe
- **10-12 strawberry mango tea bags** (herbal or black tea base)
- **10-14 tablespoons high-quality honey** (2/3 to 3/4 cup - less than chai due to fruit sweetness)
- **16 cups (1 gallon) filtered water** (divided: 6 cups for brewing, 10 cups cold)
- **3-4 tablespoons acid component** (reduced amount - fruit teas are naturally more tart)
  - **White wine vinegar** (apple-allergy safe, clean flavor)
  - **Rice vinegar** (apple-allergy safe, mild and sweet)
  - **Fresh lime juice** (complements mango flavor beautifully)
  - **Fresh lemon juice** (brightens strawberry notes)
- **1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract** (enhances fruit flavors without overpowering)
- **1/4 teaspoon sea salt** (enhances all flavors)

### Optional Enhancements
- **1 tablespoon fresh lime zest** (adds bright citrus oils)
- **1/2 cup frozen strawberries** (add during steeping for extra fruit flavor)
- **1/4 cup frozen mango chunks** (add during steeping)
- **Fresh mint leaves** (5-6 leaves during steeping for complexity)
- **1/4 teaspoon ginger powder** (adds gentle warmth)

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Strong Fruit Tea Base
1. **Heat 6 cups water** to a rolling boil
2. **Add strawberry mango tea bags** (10-12 bags for strong fruit flavor)
3. **Optional boost**: Add frozen fruit or fresh mint now
4. **Steep 12-15 minutes** (shorter than chai - fruit teas can get bitter)
5. **Remove tea bags** - squeeze gently to extract flavor
6. **Strain out any fruit pieces** if you added them
7. **You should have 5-5.5 cups concentrated fruit tea**

### Phase 2: Honey Integration
1. **While tea is still hot** (but not boiling), add honey
2. **Stir thoroughly** until completely dissolved
3. **Add vanilla extract and sea salt**
4. **Add your chosen acid component** - start with less, taste and adjust
5. **Add citrus zest** if using
6. **Taste and adjust** - more honey for sweetness, more acid for brightness

### Phase 3: Final Assembly
1. **Add remaining cold water** to reach 1 gallon total
2. **Stir well** and taste - fruit teas are naturally sweeter than chai
3. **Adjust sweetness/tartness** as needed
4. **Cool to room temperature** (or chill if preferred)
5. **Transfer to glass dispenser** or storage container

## Flavor Balancing Notes

### Strawberry Mango Tea Considerations:
üçì **Naturally sweeter** than chai - use less honey initially  
ü•≠ **Fruit teas vary widely** - some brands are more intense than others  
üçã **Acid balance critical** - fruit flavors need brightness to shine  
üçØ **Honey complements** - enhances fruit without masking flavors  

### Recommended Acid by Fruit Tea Type:
- **With herbal strawberry mango**: Use lime juice (3-4 tablespoons)
- **With black tea base**: Use rice vinegar (3-4 tablespoons)  
- **Very sweet tea blends**: Use lemon juice (4-5 tablespoons)
- **Tart tea blends**: Use rice vinegar (2-3 tablespoons)

## Apple Allergy Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Avoid apple cider vinegar if anyone has apple allergies.

### Safe Alternatives for Apple Allergies:
- **Rice vinegar**: Mild, slightly sweet - perfect with fruit flavors
- **Fresh lime juice**: Complements mango beautifully (recommended)
- **Fresh lemon juice**: Brightens strawberry notes  
- **White wine vinegar**: Clean and neutral

**Best choice for this recipe**: Fresh lime juice or rice vinegar work beautifully with strawberry mango flavors.

## Carbonation Recommendation

**For counter dispenser: NO CARBONATION**  
**For work bottles: YES, PERFECT FOR CARBONATION**

### Why still works great at home:
‚úÖ **Fruit flavors shine** at room temperature  
‚úÖ **Natural sweetness** doesn't need cold to be appealing  
‚úÖ **Easy family serving** from dispenser  
‚úÖ **Tropical vibe** works well without bubbles  

### Why carbonation is amazing for work bottles:
ü•§ **Like premium fruit soda** - strawberry mango fizz!  
üå¥ **Tropical refreshment** - perfect for work breaks  
üíº **Impressive appearance** - looks like expensive craft beverage  
‚ùÑÔ∏è **Cold + bubbly** enhances fruit aromatics  

## Individual Bottle Carbonation (Perfect for Work!)

### Method 1: Pre-Mixed Bottles
1. **Fill bottles 2/3 with strawberry mango base**
2. **Top with chilled sparkling water** (1:2 ratio works great with fruit flavors)
3. **Cap tightly** and refrigerate overnight
4. **Take to work chilled** - stays carbonated 8-12 hours

### Method 2: Separate Components
1. **Concentrate the base** (use 8 cups water instead of 16, same everything else)
2. **Small bottle of concentrate**
3. **Small bottle of sparkling water**
4. **Mix 1:3 ratio** at work (1 part concentrate, 3 parts sparkling)

### Work Bottle Pro Tips for Fruit Flavors
üßä **Extra cold is key** - fruit flavors + carbonation shine when ice-cold  
üçì **Add frozen berries** to bottles for extra fruit flavor and cooling  
ü•≠ **Garnish with lime wedge** - complements the mango perfectly  
üí° **Make slightly sweeter** for carbonated version - bubbles reduce perceived sweetness

## Storage and Shelf Life

### Counter Storage (Glass Dispenser)
- **Temperature**: 65-68¬∞F is perfect for fruit flavors
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks maximum
- **Fruit teas may develop** stronger flavor over time (often improves!)
- **Stir daily** - honey and fruit oils may separate

### Refrigerated Storage
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Fruit flavors often improve** with cold storage
- **May become slightly more tart** over time (natural fruit acids)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Too weak fruit flavor**: Use more tea bags or add frozen fruit next time  
**Too sweet**: Add more lime/lemon juice gradually  
**Too tart**: Add honey one tablespoon at a time  
**Bitter aftertaste**: Steeped tea too long - dilute with more water  
**Fruit flavors fading**: Make fresh batch - fruit teas lose potency over time  

### Quality Tips
- **Use quality fruit tea** - cheap teas often have artificial flavors
- **Don't over-steep** - fruit teas turn bitter faster than regular tea
- **Fresh citrus is best** - bottled juices don't provide the same brightness
- **Taste frequently** - fruit teas vary widely between brands
- **Serve within 2 weeks** - fruit flavors fade over time

## Family-Friendly Notes
- **Naturally appealing to kids** - tastes like sophisticated fruit juice
- **Usually caffeine-free** - most fruit teas are herbal (check labels)
