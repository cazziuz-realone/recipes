## Recipe 4: Basil Tart Fruit Mead

A **complex herbal-fruit mead** where Voss's tropical esters beautifully complement tart cranberry-raspberry and fresh basil, **completed in 4-5 weeks** at 12-13% ABV.

### Ingredients
- **3 lbs wildflower honey**
- **1.5 lbs fresh cranberries** (frozen overnight to break cells)
- **0.5 lbs fresh raspberries** (frozen overnight)
- **1 oz fresh sweet basil leaves** (or 0.5 oz dried)
- **Filtered water** to 1 gallon
- **1 packet (11g) LalBrew VOSS Kveik** (tropical esters enhance fruit complexity)
- **3g Go-Ferm Protect**
- **8g Fermaid-O total** (enhanced for fruit complexity)
- **1.5g DAP**

### Accelerated Fruit Processing Protocol
**Day 0 - Fruit Primary Setup**
1. Heat 0.5 gallon water to 160°F
2. Dissolve honey in warm water
3. Add thawed fruit in mesh bag to fermenter
4. Cool to 70-85°F and pitch Voss
5. **Voss advantage**: Vigorous start with tropical ester development

**Days 1-4 - Critical Timing**
- **Day 1**: 2g Fermaid-O + 0.5g DAP
- **Day 2**: 2g Fermaid-O + 0.5g DAP (monitor active fermentation)
- **Day 3**: 2g Fermaid-O + 0.5g DAP
- **Day 5-7**: 2g Fermaid-O (at 1/3 sugar break)

**Day 3-5 - Basil Integration (Critical Window)**
- **Perfect timing**: Add basil when gravity hits 1.080-1.090 (usually day 3-5 with Voss)
- Place fresh basil in sanitized mesh bag
- Submerge for **3-5 days** (standard timing for room temperature)
- **Taste daily** - remove when desired intensity reached

**Voss Character Development**
- **Temperature**: 70-85°F provides balanced tropical ester production
- **Speed**: Primary complete in 7-14 days
- **Complex profile**: Tropical esters bridge fruit tartness and herb complexity
- **Integration**: Orange-mango notes complement cranberry-raspberry tartness

**Enhanced Timeline**
- **Days 5-7**: Remove fruit and basil during peak fermentation
- **Days 10-14**: Fermentation completion
- **Week 3-4**: Ready to rack
- **Week 5**: Bottling ready

**Voss Advantage**: The tropical fruit esters create a bridge between the tart cranberry-raspberry and aromatic basil, resulting in a more unified, complex flavor profile with excellent reliability.

**Final Profile**
- **Target finish**: 1.010-1.015 for semi-dry character
- **Character**: Tart fruit, herbaceous basil, tropical fruit complexity
- **Ready to drink**: 5-6 weeks total
- **Optimal aging**: 3-8 months for full integration
