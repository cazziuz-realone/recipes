## Recipe 7: Coffee Mead

A **sophisticated coffee-honey fusion** where Voss's neutral character perfectly showcases coffee complexity, **completed in 4-5 weeks** at 13-14% ABV.

### Ingredients
- **3 lbs wildflower or orange blossom honey**
- **Filtered water** to 1 gallon total volume
- **1 packet (11g) LalBrew VOSS Kveik**
- **3g Go-Ferm Protect**
- **8g Fermaid-O total** (enhanced for coffee fermentation)
- **2g DAP** (diammonium phosphate)
- **1.5-2 oz medium roast coffee beans** (coarsely ground)
- **6-8 oz filtered water** (for cold brewing)
- **Stabilization chemicals** (Campden tablet, potassium sorbate)

### Coffee Preparation - Cold Brew Method
1. Coarsely grind 1.5-2 oz coffee beans
2. Steep in 6-8 oz room temperature water for 18-24 hours
3. Strain through coffee filter to remove all sediment
4. Reserve cold brew concentrate for secondary

### Voss Coffee Process
**Day 0 - Must Creation**
1. Heat 0.5 gallon water to 140°F
2. Dissolve honey completely, cool to 70-85°F
3. Transfer to fermenter, top to 1 gallon
4. Starting gravity: 1.100-1.115
5. Add 2g Fermaid-O + 0.5g DAP
6. **Pitch Voss at 70-85°F** for clean fermentation

**Enhanced Fermentation Schedule**
- **Day 1**: 2g Fermaid-O + 0.5g DAP
- **Day 2**: 2g Fermaid-O + 0.5g DAP
- **Day 3**: 2g Fermaid-O + 0.5g DAP
- **Monitor pH daily** (target 3.8-4.2, coffee can drop pH)

**Day 10-14 - Coffee Integration**
1. Rack to secondary when fermentation slows
2. Add cold brew concentrate gradually over 2-3 days
3. Start with 4 oz, taste daily, add up to 8 oz total
4. **Critical**: Add slowly to preserve aromatics

**Voss Timeline**
- **Days 1-10**: Primary fermentation (faster than wine yeast)
- **Days 10-14**: Coffee addition in secondary
- **Week 3-4**: Clarification and integration
- **Week 5**: Ready to bottle
- **Months 2-3**: Optimal drinking window begins

**pH Management Protocol**
- Coffee naturally acidifies (pH 3.4-4.5)
- Voss drops pH more aggressively than wine yeasts
- If pH drops below 3.2, add small amounts potassium bicarbonate
- Check pH before and after coffee addition

**Voss Advantages for Coffee Mead**
- **Clean profile**: Doesn't compete with coffee flavors
- **Fast fermentation**: Reduces oxidation risk
- **Temperature tolerance**: Ferments well at room temperature
- **pH resilience**: Handles coffee's acidity better than wine yeasts

**Final Character**: Rich coffee aromatics with honey sweetness backdrop, clean fermentation profile allows coffee complexity to shine, **ready to enjoy in 2-3 months, peak at 6-12 months**

**Alternative Coffee Methods**
- **Whole bean**: 0.5 oz cracked beans in secondary for 24-48 hours
- **Coffee tincture**: Steep beans in vodka, add to taste
- **Never use hot coffee**: Extracts harsh tannins and oils
