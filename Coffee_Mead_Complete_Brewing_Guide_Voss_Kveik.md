# Coffee Mead Recipe Guide for Voss Kveik

Coffee mead (coffeemel) combines honey's sweetness with coffee's complexity, creating a unique fermented beverage. **The key to success lies in cold brew coffee integration during secondary fermentation, paired with careful pH management and enhanced nutrient supplementation** when using Voss Kveik yeast at room temperature.

## Master Recipe: Voss Kveik Coffee Mead (5 Gallons)

### Ingredients

**Base Mead:**
- 15 lbs wildflower or orange blossom honey
- 4.5 gallons spring water (adjust to 5 gallons total)
- 11g Lallemand LalBrew Voss Kveik yeast
- 1.25g Go-Ferm (for yeast rehydration)

**Nutrient Schedule:**
- 18g Fermaid-K total (split into 6 additions)
- 8g DAP total (split into 4 additions)
- 1 tsp pectic enzyme

**Coffee Addition:**
- 8-10 oz high-quality medium roast coffee beans, coarsely ground
- 32-48 oz filtered water for cold brewing

**Finishing (Optional):**
- 1-2 lbs honey for back-sweetening
- 1/4 tsp potassium metabisulfite
- 1.5 tsp potassium sorbate

### Process and Timeline

**Day 0 - Pitch Day:**
1. Rehydrate yeast in Go-Ferm solution following package directions
2. Heat 2 gallons water to 140°F, dissolve honey completely
3. Cool to 75°F, adjust volume to 5 gallons
4. **Target OG:** 1.100-1.120 (13-16% potential ABV)
5. Add 4.5g Fermaid-K + 2g DAP
6. Pitch rehydrated yeast
7. Maintain 70-85°F fermentation temperature

**Days 1-7 - Primary Fermentation:**
- Day 2: Add 4.5g Fermaid-K + 2g DAP, degas gently
- Day 4: Add 4.5g Fermaid-K + 2g DAP, degas gently  
- Day 6: Add 4.5g Fermaid-K + 2g DAP, degas gently
- Monitor pH daily (target 3.8-4.2)
- **Expected timeline:** 5-7 days at 70-85°F

**Days 8-10 - Coffee Preparation:**
1. Cold brew coffee: steep 8-10 oz coarsely ground coffee in 32-48 oz filtered water for 18-24 hours
2. Strain through coffee filter to remove all sediment
3. Taste and adjust concentration if needed

**Days 10-14 - Secondary Fermentation:**
1. Rack mead off primary sediment
2. Add 1 cup cold brew coffee per gallon slowly over 2-3 days
3. **Target FG:** 1.000-1.010 (12-14% ABV)
4. Taste periodically and adjust coffee intensity

**Months 1-3 - Aging and Finishing:**
1. Rack off sediment monthly
2. Back-sweeten with honey if desired (1-2 lbs)
3. Stabilize with potassium metabisulfite and sorbate
4. Age minimum 2-3 months for flavor integration

## Alternative Recipes

### Session Coffee Mead (8-10% ABV)
- Reduce honey to 10-12 lbs (target OG 1.070-1.080)
- Use same coffee addition method
- Shorter aging time (1-2 months)
- More approachable for regular consumption

### Dessert Coffee Mead (16-18% ABV)
- Increase honey to 18-20 lbs (target OG 1.140-1.160)
- Add 2-3 lbs honey for back-sweetening
- Extended aging (6-12 months) required
- Rich, port-like character

## Technical Considerations for Voss Kveik

### Temperature Management
**Voss Kveik performs exceptionally well at 70-85°F**, producing **neutral yeast character that showcases coffee flavors**. Unlike traditional ale yeasts, Kveik maintains consistent performance across this temperature range without producing off-flavors or stalling.

### Enhanced Nutrient Requirements
Kveik evolved in high-nutrient environments and **requires double the typical nutrient amounts** compared to standard wine yeasts. The staggered addition schedule prevents nutrient shock while supporting healthy fermentation.

### pH Monitoring Protocol
Coffee naturally lowers pH (3.4-4.5 range), and **Kveik drops pH more aggressively than typical yeasts**. Monitor pH daily during the first week:
- **Target range:** 3.8-4.2
- **Critical threshold:** pH below 3.2 requires immediate correction
- **Correction method:** Add small amounts of potassium bicarbonate to raise pH

## Coffee Integration Methods

### Cold Brew Method (Recommended)
**Cold brewing extracts coffee's sweetness and complexity while avoiding harsh oils and excessive acidity** that hot brewing introduces. The 18-24 hour steep time at room temperature creates a smooth concentrate perfect for mead integration.

### Timing Considerations
**Secondary fermentation addition preserves coffee aromatics** that would otherwise be lost during vigorous primary fermentation. The alcohol environment extracts different flavor compounds than water alone, creating a more complex profile.

### Alternative Addition Methods
- **Whole bean addition:** 3-4 oz cracked beans in secondary for 24-48 hours
- **Coffee tincture:** Steep beans in vodka for 7-10 days, add to taste
- **Primary addition:** Add cold brew as part of initial must (less aromatic but more integrated)

## Troubleshooting and Quality Control

### Common Issues and Solutions
**Stuck fermentation:** Usually caused by pH below 3.2 or inadequate nutrients. Check pH immediately and supplement with potassium bicarbonate if needed.

**Excessive bitterness:** Over-extraction from hot brewing or prolonged contact time. Cold brew method virtually eliminates this issue.

**Thin mouthfeel:** Often from overpitching Kveik or insufficient residual sweetness. Consider back-sweetening with honey.

### Flavor Development Timeline
Coffee meads undergo significant flavor evolution:
- **0-3 months:** Harsh, "ashy" flavors common
- **3-6 months:** Flavors begin integrating, bitterness mellows
- **6-12 months:** Optimal drinking window for most styles
- **1+ years:** Develops complex, wine-like character

## Advanced Techniques

### Tannin Management
Coffee tannins contribute astringency but **fermentation reduces tannin content by up to 50%** through yeast metabolism. Extended primary fermentation contact time (48+ hours) maximizes this beneficial effect.

### Complementary Flavors
Consider additions that enhance coffee character:
- **Vanilla:** 1-2 vanilla beans in secondary
- **Chocolate:** Cacao nibs (2-4 oz) for mocha character
- **Spices:** Cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom in small amounts

### Professional-Grade Techniques
- **Yeast strain blending:** Combine Voss Kveik with wine yeast for complexity
- **Fruit additions:** Mulberries or blackberries complement coffee flavors
- **Oak aging:** Light oak adds tannin structure and vanilla notes

This comprehensive approach leverages Voss Kveik's unique characteristics while addressing coffee's specific fermentation challenges, resulting in a balanced, complex coffee mead with consistent quality at your preferred fermentation temperature.
