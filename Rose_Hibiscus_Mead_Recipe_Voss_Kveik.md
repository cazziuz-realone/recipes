5. **Ferment at 70-85°F** for complex floral-tropical character

**Enhanced Fermentation**
- **Day 1**: 1.75g Fermaid-O (early support)
- **Day 2**: 1.75g Fermaid-O (peak activity)
- **Day 3**: 1.75g Fermaid-O (mid-fermentation)
- **Day 5-7**: 1.75g Fermaid-O (at 1/3 sugar break)

**Complex Timeline**
- **Days 1-10**: Primary fermentation with ester development
- **Week 2-3**: Fermentation completion, natural clarification begins
- **Week 4**: Ready to rack, beautiful ruby color
- **Week 5**: Bottling ready

**Voss Enhancement**: The tropical fruit esters (especially orange and mango notes) create an exotic floral-tropical bouquet that's more complex than traditional rose-hibiscus meads.

**Character**: Ruby-red color with layered aromatics - rose and hibiscus florals backed by subtle tropical fruit complexity, **ready to drink in 5-6 weeks, peak at 3-8 months**
