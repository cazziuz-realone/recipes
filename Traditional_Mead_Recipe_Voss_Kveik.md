## Recipe 1: Traditional Mead

This foundational recipe produces a **semi-sweet traditional mead at 13-14% ABV** with subtle orange-mango esters from Voss, **completed in 2-3 weeks total**.

### Ingredients
- **2.75 lbs** high-quality varietal honey (wildflower, orange blossom, or clover)
- **Filtered water** to 1 gallon total volume
- **1 packet (11g) LalBrew VOSS Kveik** (adds subtle tropical fruit complexity to honey)
- **3g Go-Ferm Protect** (optimized for Voss nutrition)
- **6g Fermaid-O** total (enhanced Voss protocol)
- **1 Campden tablet** (potassium metabisulfite for stabilization)
- **1/4 tsp potassium sorbate** (if back-sweetening)

### Equipment
- 1-gallon glass carboy or plastic fermenter
- Blow-off tube (recommended for active Voss fermentation)
- Hydrometer and test jar
- Auto-siphon or racking cane
- Sanitizer (Star-San)
- Large pot for heating water

### Voss Process at Room Temperature

**Day 0 - Must Preparation**
1. Heat 0.5 gallon water to 160°F (do not boil)
2. Dissolve honey completely in warm water
3. Cool to 70-85°F (optimal for Voss fermentation)
4. Transfer to carboy, top to 1 gallon leaving 2.5 inches headspace
5. Test original gravity (target: 1.110-1.115)

**Voss Yeast Preparation**
1. Heat 100ml water to 104°F
2. Dissolve 3g Go-Ferm, cool to 95°F
3. Add entire packet LalBrew VOSS, wait 15 minutes
4. Gradually temper to within 15°F of must temperature
5. Pitch when must reaches 70-85°F

**Days 1-4 - Enhanced Nutrient Protocol**
- **Day 1**: Add 1.5g Fermaid-O, stir gently
- **Day 2**: Add 1.5g Fermaid-O (peak fermentation support)
- **Day 3**: Add 1.5g Fermaid-O (mid-fermentation)
- **Day 5-7**: Add 1.5g Fermaid-O (at 1/3 sugar break)

**Fermentation Management**
- **Temperature**: Maintain 70-85°F (room temperature excellent)
- **Duration**: **7-14 days primary fermentation** (faster than wine yeast)
- **Activity**: Expect vigorous fermentation within 6-12 hours
- **Character**: Subtle orange-mango esters enhance honey complexity
- **Flocculation**: Excellent - natural clearing in 1-2 weeks

**Week 1-2 - Completion**
1. Fermentation slows after 7-14 days
2. Gravity drops to 1.010-1.020
3. **Ready to rack in 2 weeks**
4. Excellent flocculation aids rapid clearing

**Week 3-4 - Secondary**
1. Rack off sediment when activity stops
2. Transfer to clean carboy
3. **Age 2-3 weeks** for clarification
4. **Ready to bottle in 4-5 weeks total**

**Final Character**: Clean honey with subtle orange-mango undertones, **drinkable in 5-6 weeks, peak at 3-6 months**
